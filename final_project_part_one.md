# Final Project: Parts 1 & 2

## Part 1: Final Project
**Tracking Broadway Audiences**

In this project, I hope to not only analyze the trends of Broadway audiences over time, when they attend most throughout the year, but also, whether the industry has grown over the past 30 years. More so, I hope to analyze whether the increase in ticket prices over time has had any impact on attendance. I will look at the industry as a whole, but also foucs on a few individual shows. 

In my first chart, I will show an analysis of Broadway audience trends based on attendance overall, ranging over the past 30 years. I would also like to compare this with the overall grosses. A stacked chart may work well for this. This will show whether attendance has grown, stayed the same, or fallen over time. 

In my second chart, I will focus on the trends over the years over each month, hoping to see if there are any natural trends that happen each year. A grid of line charts may work best to show case every year. 

In my third chart, I will focus on ticket prices in correlation to audiences. A simply line graph may work or potentially a heat map.

In my fourth, fifth, and sixth chart, I will foucs on individual shows and analyzing their average audiences against ticket prices. This will give a few insights to potential outliers and why the overall average is the way it is. 

**Major Data Source**

The bulk of my data comes from a Kaggle database (THERE IS NO DATA VISUALIZATION ON KAGGLE FOR THIS DATASET)
The data is compiled from The Broadway League and Playbill.
