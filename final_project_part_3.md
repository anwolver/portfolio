# Part 3: Final Project

1. A few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II.  Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.  Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story. 

# Final Data Story
<a href="https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/protecting-broadwaypost-pandemic/index.html" title="Protecting Broadway Post-Pandemic"> Protecting Broadway Post-Pandemic </a>

## Audience
My final project, Protecting Broadway Post-Pandemic - Identifying Yearly Trends and Audience Behavior, was focused towards Broadway Producers and Leaders. I chose to focus on this specific audience because:
1.	The data collected and showcased is generally viewed by Broadway professionals, but rarely compiled or analyzed.
2.	I wanted my story to focus on getting Broadway back-on-track and Broadway Producers/Leaders are the ones who have the power to do so. 
Since my audience has a greater knowledge of the datasets, I did not use any pictographs or simplified visualizations. The data I provided is something any Broadway Professional could understand. Therefore, my graphs leaned towards the technical side of visualization. By the end of the story, I wanted my audience to realize that now is the time to start making plans to reopen shows come late March or early April. Moreso, I wanted to give a sense of confidence by providing 10-30 years worth of data that would support my argument to fully reopen Broadway by April. 
## Changes, Specific Adjustments, and Design Decisions
As suggested from my Part II critiques, I added labels to my graphs, so viewers were easily able to see annual trends, but removed a highlighted region showcasing the trend. The graph would have been too busy, so I decided that the labels were more important for the audience to identify the natural trends. I also added two graphs that focused on smaller time periods. The idea was to show how Post-Shutdown Broadway is showing signs of returning to the natural trends of Broadway Pre-Pandemic. I also added graphs based on individual shows to see how they matched up with the industry as a whole, but also to better understand if audiences react more to ticket prices or other variables such psychographics.
My overall design concept was the gold bright lights of a Broadway Marquee. Colors of black, gold, and white were my three primary colors throughout the story.  Accompanying those colors were images of Times Square and various photos that coincide with the Broadway experience. 
## Reflection
It was reassuring to see how Broadway is already showing signs of returning to pre-pandemic trends and that audiences are not deterred by high ticket prices, something that is expected to go up as inflation settles in. My purpose was to tell a story of when audiences go to Broadway and how they may or may not react to ticket prices, and to discover if Broadway is ready to fully return. I definitely struggled to find a clear storyline. I suspect that I got so lost in the data and reporting my findings, that I lost sight of my story. Creating my setup, conflict, and resolution from the data was challenging. In the end, I was quite proud of the work that I put into the final project and I came away with not only better story telling skills, but with confidence that I could do it again, but better.
