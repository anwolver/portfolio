# Part 1: Final Project
**Tracking Broadway Audiences**

In this project, I hope to not only analyze the trends of Broadway audiences over time, when they attend most throughout the year, but also, whether the industry has grown over the past 30 years. More so, I hope to analyze whether the increase in ticket prices over time has had any impact on attendance. I will look at the industry as a whole, but also foucs on a few individual shows. 

In my first chart, I will show an analysis of Broadway audience trends based on attendance overall, ranging over the past 30 years. I would also like to compare this with the overall grosses. A stacked chart may work well for this. This will show whether attendance has grown, stayed the same, or fallen over time. 

In my second chart, I will focus on the trends over the years over each month, hoping to see if there are any natural trends that happen each year. A grid of line charts may work best to show case every year. 

In my third chart, I will focus on ticket prices in correlation to audiences. A simply line graph may work or potentially a heat map.

In my fourth, fifth, and sixth chart, I will foucs on individual shows and analyzing their average audiences against ticket prices. This will give a few insights to potential outliers and why the overall average is the way it is. 

**Major Data Source**

The bulk of my data comes from a Kaggle database (THERE IS NO DATA VISUALIZATION ON KAGGLE FOR THIS DATASET)
The data is compiled from The Broadway League and Playbill.

**Storyboard**

Initial Question: When does Broadway see most of its success and what are contributing factors? 

Setup: In setting up my story, I want to display the 1st line graph above representing Overall Broadway Grosses over a 20 year period on a Monthly Basis. I want to show the trends that appear yearly. The Estimate highlights exactly what a typical year on Broadway looks like in terms of grosses. This shows the months that Broadway sees most of it's success. 

Conflict: The next question is whether the increase in grosses is due to rise in ticket prices or a rise in ticket sales. First, I will display the Max Ticket Prices of some of the most successful shows on Broadway. Then, I will display the Seats vs. Prices graph to showcase that even as ticket prices go up, so has the number of seats sold. Prices increased by 241% since 1990 and Seats Sold has increased by 92.57% since 1990.

Resolution: I will finally showcase data from individual shows and identify if the trends are similar to the industry as a whole, whether there is a direct link between ticket prices and the number of seats sold. The majority of the productions show very little change in seats sold as ticket prices increase. The data suggests that audiences are not detered or driven to attend Broadway shows based on price. The more likely case is whether a show is popular and well received by audiences.
