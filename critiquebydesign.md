# Critique by Design

**Original**

The original design is cluttered, has no direction in use of color, and is unclear as to why it is highlighting Entitlement Programs. Overall, this graph can be simplified and be made into something less jarring to look at.

**Wireframes**

I decided to make two wireframes, one based on the overall revenue and expenses and the other on only entitlement programs. 

This first design is looking at ONLY revenues and expenses. Ideally, I would have liked the amounts listed inside the boxes, but I was limited with what Flourish gave me. However, it is interactive for viewers. When reviewed by others, it was suggested that I change that colors to a red and green, redo the title, make corrections in the pop-up box (it had revenues labeled as expenses), and label that the boxes are proportionate.
