# Part 2: Final Project 


**Research Protocol**
1. Target audience is Broadway Producers and Industry Leaders
2. I asked individuals who have a basic understanding of what Broadway is and who understand how to read and analyze more in depth data.
3. Interview Script - Are you able to understand the visualizations? What is the story trying to be told? What do you not understand? What are your recommendations?
4. Interview Feedback (See Below)
5. Changes Needed: Identify key points in data visuals, such as large dips. Remove Seats Sold graph. Obviously needs to still be build out onto Shorthand. Create better titles for graphs. Include text on graph or next to graph explaining highlighted trend.

**Interview Repsonses**
###### Interview Responses 1
> I really liked how you put a lot of information into the graphs without it being overwhelming. I could easily see the trends that you're wanting to talk about and how high ticket prices are actually less of a deterrent than one would originally think.

> "Seats sold" graph doesn't need the data labels. There are too many that are overlapping and its getting jumbled.

> Even though many people already know what happened in 2008, it might be a good idea to mention that dip.

> Overall, really clear. I could follow the idea and the story that you're trying to uncover. 

###### Interview Responses 2
> The story line is strong, but the graphs could use stronger titles and explaniations.

> The Overall Grosses graph is good, but I'm not sure why there is a shaded region, what is it? Maybe include a line in text.

> I do like that the graphs are all very streamlined and that you stayed consistent with line graphs. It’s easy for a viewer to see the trends between them.

> I do really like the story line though- it’s clear to understand and read through and the data works well with it.

**Storyboard**

Initial Question: When does Broadway see most of its success and what are contributing factors? I want to better understand current trends in Broadway sales, what time of year is most successful, and if ticket prices have any affect on ticket sales. 

Setup: In setting up my story, I want to display the 1st line graph above representing Overall Broadway Grosses over a 20 year period on a Monthly Basis. I want to show the trends that appear yearly. The Estimate highlights exactly what a typical year on Broadway looks like in terms of grosses. This shows the months that Broadway sees most of it's success. 

Conflict: The next question is whether the increase in grosses is due to rise in ticket prices or a rise in ticket sales. First, I will display the Max Ticket Prices of some of the most successful shows on Broadway. Then, I will display the Seats vs. Prices graph to showcase that even as ticket prices go up, so has the number of seats sold. Prices increased by 241% since 1990 and Seats Sold has increased by 92.57% since 1990.

Resolution: I will finally showcase data from individual shows and identify if the trends are similar to the industry as a whole, whether there is a direct link between ticket prices and the number of seats sold. For each show, I will identify percent changes and relevant information about the show. The majority of the productions show very little change in seats sold as ticket prices increase. The data suggests that audiences are not detered or driven to attend Broadway shows based on price. The more likely case is whether a show is popular and well received by audiences.
